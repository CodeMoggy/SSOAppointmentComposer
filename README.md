For a thorought description on how to use Exchange Identity tokens to simplify how to authenticate an Outlook add-in I would highly recommend you read the following [```document```](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/add-ins/authentication). 

For a deep dive into the code solution please refer to the readme described [```here```](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Outlook-Add-in-JavaScript-ValidateIdentityToken/blob/master/README.md). All of the key components of that repo can be found in my solution so the description of the classes: AuthClaimTypes.cs, AuthMetadata.cs, Base64UrlEncoder.cs, Config.cs, DecodedJSONToken.cs, IdentityToken,cs, JsonAuthMetadataDocument.cs and JsonTokenDecoder.cs still applies
